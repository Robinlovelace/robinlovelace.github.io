<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>It’s been a busy 12 months but with the <a href="https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/">Geocomputation with R</a> book nearing completion<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>
I’ve finally found some time to update my blog and do a bit of thinking, about the tangled topic of line aggregation.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-aggregate-lines" class="section level2">
<h2>Why aggregate lines?</h2>
<p>The transport ‘flow’ on any particular segment of the transport networks is the aggregate (sum) of trips that pass through it <span class="citation">(Hollander 2016)</span>.
Finding the flow across a transport network based on input data composed of individual routes, is therefore an aggregation problem.
It requires a more complex solution than that provided by the <code>aggregate()</code> function in the base R <span class="citation">(R Core Team 2018)</span> package <strong>stats</strong>, however, because the geometry of the output <code>LINESTRING</code>s will be fundamentally different than the input <code>LINESTRINGS</code> of the routes: a route network is composed of many small way segments, but a route is a single long <code>LINESTRING</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="aggregating-lines-with-overline-mki" class="section level2">
<h2>Aggregating lines with overline() MKI</h2>
<p>Creating such a route network, with aggregated values per segment, is the problem that the <a href="https://ropensci.github.io/stplanr/reference/overline.html"><code>overline()</code></a> function in the R package <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/stplanr"><strong>stplanr</strong></a> was designed to solve (see a 3.5 yr-old question on <a href="https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/139681/overlaying-lines-and-aggregating-their-values-for-overlapping-segments">gis.stackexchange.com</a> for more context).</p>
<p>The function works well and is the basis of the Route Network layer (MSOA) in the Propensity to Cycle Tool (<a href="http://www.pct.bike/">PCT</a>).
In fact it was developed precisely for this purpose, as illustrated in the image below, which shows a common visualization/analysis problem encountered by transport researchers when working with multiple routes: overlapping routes are not easy to identify from non-overlapping routes:
notice the red lines in the centre of Leeds in the image look the same as the red lines on the outskirts, despite representing much more movement.</p>
<p>To overcome the problem <code>overline()</code> was born (credit to Barry Rowlingson who wrote the foundations of the function), and it works (on a tiny dataset of 2 lines) as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(stplanr)
sl_sp = routes_fast[2:3, ]
sl_sp@data = data.frame(value = c(2, 5))
plot(sl_sp, lwd = 9, col = &quot;yellow&quot;)
rnet_sp = overline(sl_sp, attr = &quot;value&quot;)
plot(rnet_sp, add = TRUE, lwd = rnet_sp$value)</code></pre>
<p>The utility of such a function is illustrated in the figure below, which shows the original route network layer of the PCT in action over a similar area of Leeds:</p>
<p>This works great and the resulting network is used for strategic network planning: you can download route network data in the ‘Region data’ tab of the PCT <span class="citation">(Lovelace et al. 2017)</span>. The route network data for Leeds can, for example, be downloaded as a <code>.geojson</code> file from <a href="https://github.com/npct/pct-outputs-regional-notR/raw/master/commute/msoa/west-yorkshire/rnet.geojson">here</a>.</p>
<p>But there are some issues: the function works on the older <code>SpatialLinesDataFrame</code> class defined in the <strong>sp</strong> package <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="pebesma_simple_2018"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>.
This data class has been superseded by the simpler <code>sf</code> class in the <a href="https://github.com/r-spatial/sf"><strong>sf</strong></a> package, which is faster than <strong>sp</strong> for <a href="https://github.com/ATFutures/geobench">some</a> (if not many) operations.
Another issue with <code>overline()</code> is that in some cases when 2 lines meet, the resulting aggregated line can be longer than it should be.
So there are performance and functionality issues to address.
Rather than solve them all here, this post sets-out the issue using reproducible code and suggests next steps for a new <code>overline()</code> function (or perhaps just an updated <code>overline.sf()</code> function which currently just wraps <code>overline.sp()</code>).</p>
</div>
<div id="aggregating-lines-with-sf" class="section level2">
<h2>Aggregating lines with sf</h2>
<p>Rather that starting from scratch and writing a geographic algorithm from the ground-up, we will start by exploring solutions provided by existing packages, notably <strong>sf</strong>, which provides an interface to the <code>GEOS</code> library.</p>
<p>Let’s start simple, with just 2 lines, which have an associated amount of flow (with illustrative values of 2 and 5 in this case):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(stplanr)
sl = routes_fast_sf[2:3, ]
sl$value = c(2, 5)</code></pre>
<p>These lines clearly have a decent amount of overlap, which can be extracted using the function <code>st_intersection()</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sl_intersection = sf::st_intersection(sl[1, ], sl[2, ])
plot(sl$geometry, lwd = 9, col = sf::sf.colors(2, alpha = 0.5))
plot(sl_intersection, add = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>Furthermore, we can find the aggregated value associated with this new segment as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sl_intersection$value = sum(sl_intersection$value, sl_intersection$value.1)</code></pre>
<p>We still do not have a full route network composed of 3 non-overlapping lines, however:
the original lines need to be ‘clipped’ so that they do not overlap with <code>sl_intersection</code>.
This can be done as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sl_seg1 = sf::st_difference(sl[1, ], sl_intersection)
sl_seg2 = sf::st_difference(sl[2, ], sl_intersection)
plot(sl$geometry, lwd = 9, col = sf::sf.colors(2, alpha = 0.5))
plot(sl_seg1, add = TRUE)
plot(sl_seg2, add = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>We now have all the geographic components needed for a route network.
The only remaining task is to combine them, using <code>rbind</code>, right?
Not quite: the following command fails:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rnet = rbind(sl_seg1, sl_seg2, sl_intersection)</code></pre>
<p>Lesson: we need to be more careful in isolating the value to aggregate.
We will therefore run the previous stages again, but with <code>attrib</code> set to the attribute we would like to aggregate over (<code>value</code> in this case):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>attrib = &quot;value&quot;
attrib1 = paste0(attrib, &quot;.1&quot;)
sl_intersection = sf::st_intersection(sl[1, attrib], sl[2, attrib])
sl_intersection[[attrib]] = sl_intersection[[attrib]] + sl_intersection[[attrib1]]
sl_intersection[[attrib1]] = NULL</code></pre>
<p>That leaves us with a ‘clean’ object that only has a value (7) for the attribute column name we want (<code>value</code>).</p>
<p>On this basis we can proceed to create the other segments, keeping only the column we’re interested in. To save time and typing, we’ll create both segments in a single command:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sl_seg = sf::st_difference(sl[attrib], sf::st_geometry(sl_intersection))
rnet = rbind(sl_intersection, sl_seg)</code></pre>
<p>It worked! Now we’re in a position to plot the resulting route network, with ‘width’ proportional to the flow along each segment:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(rnet, lwd = rnet$value)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="a-benchmark" class="section level2">
<h2>A benchmark</h2>
<p>To test that the method is fast, or is at least not slower than the original <code>overline()</code> function, at least for this task, we’ll package-up the method in a new function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>overline_sf2 = function(sl, attrib) {
  attrib = &quot;value&quot;
  attrib1 = paste0(attrib, &quot;.1&quot;)
  sl_intersection = sf::st_intersection(sl[1, attrib], sl[2, attrib])
  sl_intersection[[attrib]] = sl_intersection[[attrib]] + sl_intersection[[attrib1]]
  sl_intersection[[attrib1]] = NULL
  sl_seg = sf::st_difference(sl[attrib], sf::st_geometry(sl_intersection))
  rnet = rbind(sl_intersection, sl_seg)
  return(rnet)
}</code></pre>
<p>If you are new to scripts/algorithms/functions, it may be worth taking a look at the new <a href="https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/algorithms.html">Algorithms</a> chapter in our near-complete book that teaches a range of geographic methods that use R <span class="citation">(Lovelace, Nowosad, and Muenchow 2019)</span>.
Now the method has been put in a function, we can compare its performance with the per-existing <code>overline()</code> function for comparison:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bench::mark(check = F,
            overline.sp = overline(sl_sp, attrib = &quot;value&quot;),
            overline.sf = overline(sl, attrib = &quot;value&quot;),
            overline_sf2 = overline_sf2(sl, attrib = &quot;value&quot;)
            )</code></pre>
<p>The results are not Earth-shattering: the new function seems to be around the same speed as the original, if a little faster.
This is great news, but remember: the new function only works on 2 lines so is much simpler.
More work needed!</p>
</div>
<div id="next-steps" class="section level2">
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>The next step is to generalist this method so it works for many (potentially thousands) of lines in a way that scales, something that should help on the visualization side, a topic that attracts much interest (see for example this <a href="https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/778/representation-of-network-flows">gis.stackexchange post</a> on the subject and, more broadly, a recent <a href="https://nowosad.github.io/post/maps-distortion/">article</a> showing how to make animated maps by Jakub Nowosad).
There is also work to do on performance but, as Donald Knuth said <span class="citation">(Knuth 1974)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>premature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of it) in programming</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So a more complete <code>overline.sf()</code> function is needed.
That will (hopefully) be the topic of the next blog post.</p>
