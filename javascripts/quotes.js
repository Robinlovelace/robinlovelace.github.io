"[Poor people] travel less often and over shorter distances than the average population, but the social and economic consequances of this behaviour, such as reduced work and educational opportunities and poor access to healthcare and other essential services, all to often have been overlooked. In part this is because the policy professionals have poorly understood `transport poverty' and its impact on social welfare (Lucas, 2004)",
"Simplicity is the hallmark of any good theory and apparent complexity is often simplicity in disguise. (Batty 1976) Urban Modelling.",
"The general importance of transport is not in doubt, but its very ordinariness leads to to its general acceptance and to a widespread assumption that transport is not a particularly interesting subject of study, except when things go wrong. (Hoyle and Knowles, 1992).",
"The bikeâ€™s engine uses energy with an efficiency of 0.25. (David MacKay 2009) Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air.",
"Human beings are remarkably adept at discerning relationships from visual representations. A well-crafted graph can help you make meaningful comparisons among thousands of pieces of information, extracting patterns not easily found through other methods. This is one reason why advances in the field of statistical graphics have had such a major impact on data analysis. Data analysts need to look at their data, and this is one area where R shines. (Kabacoff, 2009, p. 45).",
"Future ages will certainly look back upon us as a people so immersed in the pursuit of wealth as to be blind to high considerations. They will charge us with having culpably allowed the destruction of some of those records of Creation which we had it in our power to preserve; and while professing to regard every living thing as the direct handiwork and best evidence of a Creator, yet, with a strange inconsistency, seeing many of them perish irrecoverably from the face of the earth, uncared for and unkown. Alfred Russel Wallace, 1863.",
"Mass production of liquid biofuels fermented from annual harvests of crop or residual biomass would require large storages of either cereal or cellulosic feed stocks or the produced ethanol (or both), and the bulkiness of residues and relatively low energy densities of all of these materials would make such storages more costly than those of refined oils. (Smil 2010)",
"Fear paralyses creativity, stultifies the imagination, reduces problem-solving ability, damages health, depletes energy, saps intelligence and destroys hope. Maitland 2014",
