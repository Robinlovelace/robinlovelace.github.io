# The emerging cyclist culture in Barcelona

## Introduction

Barcelona is not a city traditionally associated with the bicycle. 
Yet thanks to investment in the "Bicing" bicycle share scheme 
which began [in 2007](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicing) - three years before
the launch of [London's equivalent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_Cycle_Hire) - 
and associated bicycle infrastructure this has changed. In 2011, Barcelona was 
rated as number 3 in the [Copenhagenize](http://copenhagenize.eu/index/index.html) chart
of bicycle friendliness (this has since slipped to 12th) and bicycles are now a common 
sight in the city. 

The rate of cycle uptake overall and the effectiveness the Bicing scheme specifically 
are open to debate, as illustrated by [an article questionning the cost effectiveness](http://barcelonabicycle.blogspot.com/2012/06/barcelona-bicycle-mumbers.html)
of the scheme and a [presentation](http://www2.uwe.ac.uk/services/Marketing/research/pdf/ISHEpdfs/ISHE-events/Bike%20sharing%20020713%20M%20Ricci.pdf) 
criticising the lack of evidence on the subject.

In the grand scheme of things, Barcelona's bicycle hire system is medium sized, comprising 
around 6,000 bicycles (compared with over 8,000 in London and over 20,000 in Paris)   
spread across over 420 parking bays. The spatial distribution of these parking spaces is 
quite evenly spread across Barcelona's city centre, as can be seen in a 
[real time bike availability map](https://www.bicing.cat/es/formmap) of the scheme.
(To compare this distribution with that in other cities, please see Oliver O'Brien's amazing 
'meta map' of [bicycle share schemes worldwide](http://bikes.oobrien.com/global.php)).
The scheme has a relatively high number of bicycles per docking station and 
appears to be in the top 5 largest rental schemes worldwide, according to data from 
[a detailed study on the matter by Oliver O'Brien and others](http://www.complexcity.info/files/2013/08/BATTY-JTG-2013.pdf)
(see figure below).

As the debate about the effectiveness of such schemes rumbles on, and new datasets and 
analyses trickle out with frustrating slowness, this article takes an altogether more 
personal approach to cycling in Barcelona. It is proudly subjective, being based 
on 3 days of pleasant exploration of the city in early March (not a time associated with 
high bike use by any means) on one weekday (Friday 28th) and the weekend.
Pictures can provide insight that words cannot, so I try to keep the description
brief. So let's embark on this personal visual exploration of the city's emerging 
cycling culture. Vamanos!

## The look and feel of the Barcelona cycling experience

Despite it's 'medium' size in international terms, one of the first cyclist-related things one is likely to notice
is the Bicing system itself. The docking bays are indeed huge, with dozens of neatly stashed 
bicycles ready to grab with just the swipe of a card.

Beyond the impressive provision of bicycles, the Bicing project planners have clearly
gone out of their way to create a space for cyclists across the city as well. 
The provision of lights with bicycle symbols in them is a good example of this, 
even though Barcelona's urban cyclists rarely seem to pay attention to traffic lights 
of any kind!

The contrast with Copenhagen, where cycling is highly regimented - and where anecdote and 
personal experience suggest you get hounded if you dare to stray onto the road! - could 
barely be greater. Bicycles are generally permitted to go where they please, and the 
bicycle paths tend only to provide general guidance. The above photo is a good example of this:
one can choose whether to go in the dedicated bike lane or, because the pavement is wide and 
relatively empty, can equally meander accross the pedestrian zone. The fact that this 
is tolerated makes cycling in Barcelona feel liberating compared with other cities where 
one is corralled into small spaces.

Perhaps this feeling is due more to the spacious layout of the city than 
good cycle infrastructure design: the streets are generally amply wide for 
pedestrians, cyclists and even cars to rub along quite nicely together, 
with a level of self-autonomy (red light jumping and jay walking are the norm)
that seems to be accepted. This differs from London, where the politics to 
of traffic lights and road ettiquette seems to generate infinite debate and intrigue. 
In Barcelona's bicycle culture, I argue (based on admitedly sparse evidence), there 
is a tendency just to get on with where you are going without worrying too much about 
the underlying politics of mobility.
