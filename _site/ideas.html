<p>Here is a small list of ideas for this website:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each major category on the website begins with a high quality, general introduction to the 
topic and then, after a dividing line, continues with the most recent posts in that area.</li>
  <li>New categories: bicycles, energy, academia, economics, politics, thesis, videos, Hire Me! (satirical), 
heroes (sound cloud of The Fall - No More heros).</li>
  <li>Add a dynamic map of my travels by bicycle.</li>
  <li>Social media, ‘follow’ etc?</li>
  <li>About?</li>
  <li>Calendar</li>
</ul>
