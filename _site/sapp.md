I would like to apply for the post of Lecturer / Senior Lecturer in Quantitative Methods at the University of Sheffield's soon to be launched Methods Institute. I have a diverse training and set of experiences which I believe make me uniquely placed to take on the role in the Q-Step Centre. The development of the BA in Quantitative Social Science (QSS) is of great personal interest to me: I have long championed the use of quantitative information and analysis to inform all areas of knowledge. My commitment to and strong belief in evidence-based policy is a driving force behind my current research and teaching activities at the University of Leeds, and in part explains my desire to take on the role. It is this powerful motivation, underlying my academic and professional credentials, that will enable me to flourish under the heightened pressures of a leadership role.

The role requires not only someone who can teach, research and coordinate world class social science research (my CV contains evidence on each of these), but someone who can lead and manage a complex project. The role will involve forging a set of innovative modules for a completely new undergraduate degree. It is therefore important to say something on this subject before describing my academic merits, with respect to my own experience. In 2009 when I moved to Sheffield to start the 4-year E-Future's Doctoral Training Centre programme – itself a pioneering new cross-departmental collaboration – I arrived with a very strong personal motivation and commitment: to advance the debate on energy issues and inspire people to think about the implications of new scientific knowledge for society. A small but personally very important part of this commitment and effort was to set up the Wind Turbine Group through Engineers Without Borders.

As a geographer, this was obviously a huge challenge but one that I learned to navigate and eventually excel at. I quickly learned about leadership on the job: the importance of group dynamics, working with the team via delegation and leading through example rather than dictum. I had to acknowledge the limits to my knowledge regularly, and understand the strengths of different fields. In the summer of 2010, after hundreds of hours of collective work, our wind turbine was erected for the first time and the feeling of collective achievement generated inspires me to this day. The experience of managing projects for a diverse student society has provided many of the inter-personal skills needed for Lecturer position. Stretching the analogy, I want to be part of a new wind turbine project: a long-term collective effort to build something complex yet robust that inspires hundreds of people.

I strongly feel that my academic qualifications make me well suited to the role. My PhD in the Energy Costs of Commuting involved the extensive use of advanced quantitative methods, some of which were developed, to an interdisciplinary field of knowledge: transport and energy. My MSc in Environmental Science and Management shows my grounding in multi-disciplinary quantitative research. Going further back, my longstanding interest in and use of Mathematics, the ultimate language of numerical information and relationships, underlies much of my work. My GCSE performance (A*) led me to take 'Fast Track Mathematics': an intensive course in which an A level is done in one year. I flourished in this high pressure environment. However, I wanted to apply my skills to the real world. Hence I continued with Psychology and Geography, whilst taking on Archaeology and English at As level to broaden my understanding of the world. These subject choices demonstrate that I thrive on diversity whilst maintaining a commitment to rigorous and logical thinking demanded by mathematics.

It was this grounding in rigorous abstract thinking combined with a strong interest in world affairs that led me to take Geography with a Year's Study in continental Europe. During my time in Bristol and Salamanca I continued my multi-disciplinary interests, with modules in subjects such as MATLAB and linear algebra on the methods side and Geographies of Food and Nature and Society on the applied side. Throughout, I was looking for synthesis, ways of combining insights from advanced quantitative methods to policy-relevant problems of the everyday world.

I was awarded a scholarship to continue my studies at the University of York in Environmental Science and Management. There I learned a wide range of methodological skills, some of which I still use on a daily basis today. In particular I taught myself R, with a little help from my dissertation supervisor Jim Smart, an environmental economist. It was at York that I discovered economics, and found yet another area of academia where numerical reasoning could be applied to generate policy relevant findings. It was also at York where I developed my enduring interest in energy, which led to independent research on the management of York Minster, a dissertation on street lighting in York, a multidisciplinary work at the interface between local policy, social preferences and environmental economics.

These experiences made me well-placed to apply for the newly created Doctoral Training Centre in E-Futures in 2009, where I set-up the aforementioned wind turbine project. I thrived in the multi-disciplinary environment, working alongside Engineers and physical and social scientists from a wide range of disciplines.

This commitment to interdisciplinary work is also visible in my publications. I have coauthored work with colleagues from Psychology (Uttley and Lovelace, under review), Local Authority Transport Planning departments (Lovelace et al., 2011), Politics (Lovelace and Temple, 2012), Transport Studies (Lovelace and Philips, 2014) and Geography (Lovelace et al., 2014). I am also comfortable working alongside engineers and physical scientists, as illustrated by longstanding collaboration with a Road Engineer on a recently completed book project (McLoughlin and Lovelace, in press). This is important as some important innovations in the social sciences are being made by those from the 'harder' sciences (e.g. Simini et al., 2012).

I have a strong and rapidly growing research profile (see my publications list, in the CV). Not only am I productive: my work has impact. This is well illustrated by citations to my work and the fact that my methodological developments in the field of spatial microsimulation (Lovelace and Ballas, 2013) have been picked up and applied by others.

I have experience of applying for funding, as illustrated by the successful bids I wrote to fund the Wind Turbine and Pedal Powered Machines projects for Engineers Without Borders. More recently I have applied to a number of fellowships and have contributed to wider funding bids at the University of Leeds.

In terms of teaching and module development I have very strong credentials. I have developed several comprehensive tutorial-style working papers, as can be seen in the list of publications in my CV. Of these I would like to draw particular attention to “Introducing spatial microsimulation with R” (Lovelace, 2014). To my knowledge this is the first practical introduction to spatial microsimulation using R anywhere, and the 1.5 course for which it was developed attracted participants from across the UK and one from the USA. This demonstrates my ability to design world leading teaching material of interest to an international audience. The NCRM working paper on visualising spatial data with R (Lovelace and Cheshire, 2014) has been downloaded thousands of times by an international audience. The fact that I have developed these materials from scratch and then taught them to a highly qualified post-graduate audience shows my readiness to lead a pathway in the Q-Step Centre. My expertise in GIS and spatial data processing and modelling makes me ideally suited to the “human geography, town planning and landscape” pathway in the BA QSS course. However, the strength of my skills in quantitative methods would enable me to contribute greatly to the other pathways.

In summary, I feel that I am a strong and passionate candidate for the role with a unique combination of skills and experience encompassing leadership, academic research capability and the development and delivery of world class teaching materials in cutting edge methods in quantitative social sciences.

Thank you for considering my application.
