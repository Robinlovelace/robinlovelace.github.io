title: Sheffield to Manchester cycle
published: true
---

I arrived in Manchester around 2pm, having set-off from Sheffield at 9am and 
cycled all the way. 
This may sound like a [masochistic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadomasochism) 
mid-February activity. But I can only report good vibes: a subtle rush of 
[endorphins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorphins) released from pushing the 
body and the satisfaction of knowing I got here with my own energies alone, 
rather than depending on [ancient sunlight](http://techalive.mtu.edu/meec/module19/Page4.htm)
stored in fossil fuels and imported from afar. 

The route I took was fast, fun, safe yet exciting. 
Having done the trip a few times before,
and feeling sure that this was the best route 
I've taken so far, I'm to share
it with the world. The actual route I took was recorded by the 
GPS on my smartphone (which I uploaded to [GPSies](http://gpsies.com/)), 
enabling it to be stored for posterity and downloaded by others for 
future reference. I wouldn't say this is the *best* possible 
route from Sheffield to Manchester, but I would recommend it to most 
cyclists, for reasons outlined below.

## Deciding the route in advance

To be honest, I didn't put a lot of thought into planning the route 
in advance. Simply typing "Sheffield" and "Manchester" into the 
from and to fields in the open source bicycle route planner
[CycleStreets.net](http://www.cyclestreets.net/) yields 3 options, 
the fastest of which looked reasonable to me. Each of these can 
be seen on the [route's own web page](http://www.cyclestreets.net/journey/39363548/), automatically generated and 
stored for posterity.

As you'll see from the [route's page](http://www.cyclestreets.net/journey/39363548/), 
CycleStreets.net very handily provides turn-by-turn breakdown of the trip, including 
[links to photos uploaded to the internet by enthusiasts](http://www.cyclestreets.net/location/33925/) and sub-maps of key parts of the route, such as the one 
displayed below.

I did also try planning the route using 
[Google's bicycle route planning option](https://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Sheffield,+United+Kingdom&daddr=Manchester,+United+Kingdom&hl=en&ll=53.466796,-1.841583&spn=0.409566,0.883026&sll=53.426314,-1.86006&sspn=0.409953,0.883026&geocode=FQmILgMde5Hp_ykVvuj6qQp5SDF4sAav9ScoPg%3BFZwHMAMd27Dd_ynb9SZSTE16SDGqa_4EOBS-2Q&oq=man&dirflg=b&mra=ltm&t=m&z=10&lci=bike)
and was heartened to see that, after forcing the route onto the exciting 
[Snake Pass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_Pass) the 
[result](http://goo.gl/maps/2uwXz) was similar to the CycleStreets option:

Basically, I was happy with the distance (~40 miles), time estimated by CycleStreets (4 1/2 hours) and Google (4 1/4 hours) and was confident that I could get onto the Snake Pass without 
need for navigation. Owning a smartphone, I decided to play it by ear and wait for instructions
from CycleStreets.net or Google on how to navigate myself to Manchester city centre. 
As explained below, I was pleasantly surprised.

## The ride itself

Speed vs fun vs safety compromise. 

Google maps navigation.

Glossop.

Sheffield to Manchester is a well worn path ...

With the ascendency of cycling as a fun, healthy cheap and environmentally friendly form of 
transport, there has also been much interest in doing the trip by bike. 

## Alternative routes

I am 
by no means the first to attempt the journey, and many alternative routes are available online.
[Cycle Sheffield](http://www.cyclesheffield.org.uk/), offers a 
[detailed description](http://www.cyclesheffield.org.uk/route-planning/long-distance-routes/sheffield-to-manchester/)
of a 
largely rural route (see map below). 

<iframe src="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msa=0&amp;msid=204112132629730101627.0004a38bf89ff2c48e1cb&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;ll=53.390534,-1.793089&amp;spn=0.112659,0.661068&amp;output=embed" height="350" width="425" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><br />

This route avoids the car-infested Snake and Woodhead Pass, the former 
because "it is narrow and has fast traffic", the latter being "a highly undesirable place to be for a cyclist". 
Having ridden both routes, I would say that both descriptions are a little exagerated: yes cars tend to 
whizz over the snake pass and yes there is a high proportion of trucks in the traffic in the flow over Woodhead. 
But neither felt inherently dangerous at any time: in some ways the long expanses of road space felt safer
per kilometre than urban traffic, which is far less predictable (due to cars pulling out, traffic lights, left
and right turns and other urban phonomena).

An even more rural route is the [trans pennine trail](http://www.gps-routes.co.uk/routes/home.nsf/RoutesLinksCycle/trans-pennine-trail-walking-and-cycle-route), a completely off-road trail of which Sheffield-Manchester is 
only a part: it runs from coast to coast. Again, this route is ideal for leisure purposes, but 
will be much slower than the road option I took.

## Reflections and doing it again
