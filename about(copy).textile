h2. About Robin Lovelace

I am an ecotechnic engineer, bicycle mechanic, computer programmer
and open-source advocate. Above all, I'm a geographer. I reject the 
separation between yourself and your work and look up to the 
great geographers of the past, like Elisee Reclus and Alexander von Humbolt 
for inspiration in this increasingly specialised world. I like to try my hand 
at things. 

More specifically, I graduated from Bristol in 2008 with a 1st class degree 
in Geography, fluent Spanish - thanks to an Erasmus year in Salamanca -
and a burning desire to stop the world burning, having been taught
atmospheric physics by Paul Valdes. I won a scholarship to do an MSc 
in Environemental Science at York, where I developed a strong interest in energy. 

At this time it seemed many in academia had developed a strong interest in 
energy also. Climate change and fuel security were high on the political 
agenda in the wake of the IPCC's 4th report and the oil price shock (and subsequent recession)
in 2008. I was offered PhDs at two places: Cambridge and Sheffield. 
The fresh air, higher pay and above all more physically grounded nature the 
E-Futures course led me to choose the latter and I have not looked back since. 
I continued to pursue my interest in bicycles, and this eventually led to a 
paper in Energy Policy about their relative energy costs. This eventually led
to my PhD topic, the energy costs of travel to work. 

The final part of this brief story is methodological: in order to understand 
the reasons for high and low levels of energy use in commuting, you need to 
understand people. So, in collaboration with my supervisor Dimitris Ballas, 
we set about developing methods of spatial microsimulation - or modelling 
individuals over space - for the task at hand. I confirmed my belief in the 
benefits of open source software, seeing the benefits it had if academic 
prececessors had made their code available to the world. A minor 
innovation in spatial microsimulation methods (integerisation) led to another 
paper, and that is what helped me get the job in Leeds. My role now is to 
continue developing methods to better understand mundane geographical processes such 
as commuting, the school run and simply going to the shops. I have a strong 
belief in the need to transition to a post-carbon society, so I will endeavour 
(acknowledging my bias) to help make this happen, in some small way, through 
my research.

If you'd like get in touch about anything, please hit me up via email
(R.Lovelace@leeds.ac you know the rest), phone (07837  788-663, sorry for
formatting wierdness - don't want internet robots harvesting all my infor), 
Twitter (robinlovelace) or even youtube.com/robinlovelace. 

Cheers for reading!

h2. About This Site

This site is built using the "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll library and hosted on "GitHub":http://github.com/. The source code  used to create this library is "publicly available on  GitHub":http://github.com/schacon/schacon.github.com as  well. I hope to port this experiment into a a full website  solution in 2013, so any feedback greatufully received.
