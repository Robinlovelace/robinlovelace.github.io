      <description>I’ve finally got a new blog post, to test that my new set-up is working, using the wonderful new blogdown package.
Here’s a test plot, to show how it allows R code to be embedded:
plot(1:9) Now that I have a quick-fire and fun way of getting new content onto the web I expect to be blogging lots more.

      <description>After 2 years in the making, the paper describing the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT), and the thinking behind it, has finally been published (Lovelace et al. 2016). The PCT is an online tool for helping to decide where to prioritise cycling policies such as new cycle paths.
The PCT would not have been possible without CycleStreets.net, so as well as describing the PCT and it&amp;rsquo;s use of their routing services, this article serves as a big Thank You from PCT to CycleStreets.</description>

      <title>Geostat2016 Albacete: a write-up</title>

      <description>Last week I went to GEOSTAT 2016. Given the amount of fun had at GEOSTAT 2015, expectations were high. The local organisers did not disappoint, with a week of lectures, workshops, spatial data competitions and of course lots of Geostatistics. It would be unwise to try to systematically document such a diverse range of activities, and the GEOSTAT website provides much further info. Instead this &amp;lsquo;miniwriteup&amp;rsquo; is designed to summarise some of my memories from the event, and encourage you to get involved for GEOSTAT 2017.</description>

      <title>Moving house by bicycle trailer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in 2009 I moved from York to Sheffield to start a PhD on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://e-futures.group.shef.ac.uk/page/home/&#34;&gt;Energy Futures&lt;/a&gt; 4 year Doctoral Training Centre.
Young and naive, some friends and I decided to do it by bicycle, with one bicycle trailer filled to the brim and 4 large panniers carrying most of my stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 years later and I&amp;rsquo;ve moved again, this time to Leeds. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a new a job at Leeds University,
 working on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.geotalisman.org/&#34;&gt;Geotalisman&lt;/a&gt; project in the department of geography.
Older and hopefully wiser, I decided to move house by bicycle again: it&amp;rsquo;s shorter than the trip to York
(40 miles, not 60), I was more organised with planning (providing a month&amp;rsquo;s notice for friends and
family to attend and after 4 years in Sheffield I knew many people who would be up for the ride.
To make it more exciting, this time we brought music, in the form of a 12v sound system.
See the map, words, images and video below for the full low-down on this epic ride.&lt;/p&gt;
