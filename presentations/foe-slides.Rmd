> The â€˜Propensity to Cycle Toolâ€™ shows that if residents of Greater Manchester were as likely to cycle as the Dutch we would increase commuter journeys ten-fold, leaving room on the road for people who had to drive. This level of cycling would lead to an estimated Â£1 billion per year saving to individuals and the local economy because of the resulting health benefits. (British Cyclingâ€™s chief executive, Julie Harrington, November 2017 see [britishcycling.org.uk](https://www.britishcycling.org.uk/campaigning/article/20171102-campaigning-news-British-Cycling-responds-to-Mayor-of-Greater-Manchester-Andy-Burham-s--congestion-conversation--0))

> City cycling czar Chris Boardman has unveiled plans for a thousand miles of interlinked bike and walking lanes across Greater Manchester. Dubbed â€˜Beelinesâ€™, the game-changing 10-year, Â£1.5bn proposal includes 75 miles of segregated cycle lanes similar to those found in Holland and Denmark ([Manchester Evening News](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/cycling-walking-lanes-greater-manchester-14832995))
