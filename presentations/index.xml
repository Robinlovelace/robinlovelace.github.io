      <description>In place of a planned MUSA Masterclass talk in person, a remote lecture was scheduled via the wonders of new digital technologies, on transport data science.
Although not as in-depth as the MUSA Masterclass talk, which has been postponed until April 2021 due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, this talk will give a high-level overview of some of the topics that I will talk about, based on a case study from Leeds, UK, the home of the Institute for Transport Studies.</description>

      <description>Invited seminar and workshop, UniversitÃ© catholique de Louvain Hosted by Christan Ritter, this invited talk will take place at the Institute of Statistics, Biostatistics and Actuarial Sciences.
 Abstract Data Science has emerged as an area of high and consistent growth in many sectors. High tech industries such as search engine optimisation, marketing and retail analytics have been quick to adopt new workflows. Transport has arguably been slow to adapt to the transformations towards open source software (as opposed to proprietary products that still dominate), command line and scriptable interfaces (unlike the graphical user interfaces of tools such as Excel) and code sharing and version development via platforms such as GitHub.</description>

      <guid>/presentations/geocompr-launch/</guid>
      <description>Lecture and book launch, part of Leeds Digital Festival This talk will introduce Geocomputation with R, a new book on R for geographic data that has just been published. Aimed at people new to the subject, Iâ€™ll provide some examples to show the power of programming with open source software for high-performance, reproducible mapping and geographic analyis. I will cover a bit of the history but focus on visualisation, which is key to using data to understand the world.</description>

      <description>Keynote talk at SatRdays Newcastle Geocomputation with R: Reproducible Geo* workflows, from getting data to making maps This talk will introduce Geocomputation with R, a new book on R for geographic data. It will demonstrate how far R has evolved as an environment for geographic data analysis and visualisation, and provide a taster of what is in the book and, more importantly, what is possible when &amp;lsquo;data science&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;GIS&amp;rsquo; meet.</description>

      <description>  This was the finale of a week of research collaboration and teaching at the Friedrich-Schiller-UniversitÃ¤t Jena Institut fÃ¼r Geographie. During the study visit I also worked on Geocomputation with R with fellow co-author Jannes Muenchow and wrote a tutorial on route network analysis in R that can be found at https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocomp-tranport-workshop
