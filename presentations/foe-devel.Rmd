# Abstract

Digital technology is increasingly important in development work and research,

- generating the evidence base on which strategic investments are made
- providing a powerful mechanism for researching alternative futures.

# Future digital tools

---

# Are already here I

- Example: the Propensity to Cycle Tool ([PCT.bike](http://www.pct.bike/)) (Lovelace et al. 2017)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/npct/pct-team/master/figures/early.png")
```

---

# Are already here II

- Example: the Cycling Infrastructure Prioritisation Toolkit ([CyIPT.bike](https://www.cyipt.bike))

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.cyipt.bike/images/existing-edit.png")
```

---

# Are already here III

- Example: StreetMix ([streetmix.net](https://streetmix.net/))

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("http://1p40p3gwj70rhpc423s8rzjaz-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016_0211_2ndAvePioneerSquareFlyer-streetmix.jpg")
```

---

# Are already here IV

See the 'Active Transport Tool': http://35.233.61.182/


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ATFutures/who/master/fig/accra-flow1-interactive.png")
```

# Discussion points

---

### How can we make digital tech participatory?

- User friendly?
- Mobile native?
- User input?

--

- But who sets-up and runs the servers?
- How to build digital tech capacity (education)?

---

### Gamification

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("citybound.png")
```

- Completely open source, written in [rust](https://github.com/citybound/citybound)
- Source: video at https://aeplay.org/citybound
