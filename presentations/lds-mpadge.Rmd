# Globally scalable software for sustainable transport

Open source software and increasingly open access datasets have made digital tools for transport planning available to more people than ever before.
However, many of the available products are limited by the scale at which they can operate.
Recent developments such as the UrbanSim data science toolkit (written primarily in Python) and the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) online mapping tool for prioritising where to build new cycle paths (written in R) have demonstrated that open source software *can* scale to model transport systems, to city/regional and national levels respectively.
This seminar will present an approach to modelling transitions away from fossil fuels which involves less driving but more walking and cycling that can scale globally.
Much of the software needed for this approach to work in practice has already been published, in R packages **osmdata** and **dodgr**, which are availabe under the terms of the GPL-3 License.
The talk will provide an overview of the approach, a demonstrations of the software and a discussion of an ambitious plan to scale it worldwide.
