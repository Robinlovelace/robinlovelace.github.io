      <p>I recently delivered a workshop on a practical introduction to
<a href="http://shiny.rstudio.com/">shiny</a>, an R package that enables development,
testing and deployment of interactive web applications.
Delivered at the University of Sydney&rsquo;s Institute for Transport and Logistics
Studies (<a href="http://sydney.edu.au/business/itls">ITLS</a>), it was designed for people
who are a) fairly new to R (which can seem intimidating) and b) completely new to
shiny.</p>

<p>This article provides resources for people wanting to apply shiny to
real-world applications and some context which explains the motivations
behind running the workshop. The pdf tutorial, example code
to create and modify your own apps and a place to contribute to this
free teaching resource is available at the following GitHub repository:
<a href="https://github.com/Robinlovelace/learning-shiny">github.com/Robinlovelace/learning-shiny</a></p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="my-first-shiny-app">My first shiny app</h2>

<p>My first shiny app was <a href="https://robinlovelace.shinyapps.io/rentSplit/">rentSplit</a>,
which overcomes the problem faced when people move in together but can&rsquo;t decide
on who should pay what because some rooms are better than others. (I would
like to add &lsquo;income&rsquo; to this app to allow for minted people to pay more!):</p>

<iframe src="https://robinlovelace.shinyapps.io/rentSplit/" style="border: none; width: 600px; height: 800px"></iframe>

<p>The relatively painless experience of creating this app made me wonder if shiny
could be used in transport policy applications and help us achieve the transition
away from <a href="http://www.postcarbon.org/">fossil fuels</a> that
<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v517/n7533/full/nature14016.html">scientists say is needed to avoid dangerous climate change</a>.</p>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<p>To put shiny in the context of transport planning I began with a talk on the
motivations behind online visualisation tools: the increased
focus on &lsquo;<a href="http://www.esrc.ac.uk/funding-and-guidance/impact-toolkit/">impact</a>&lsquo;
in academic funding decisions, the need for public engagement and the
democratisation of decision-making processes, as illustrated by the
interactive <a href="http://www.cyclecityconnect.co.uk/participate.php">web map</a> created by transport consultancy Steer Davies Gleave
(<a href="http://www.steerdaviesgleave.com/">SDG</a>) to enable geolocated online discussion
of a new Â£20 million <a href="http://www.cyclecityconnect.co.uk/">cycle path</a>
that will connect the English cities of <a href="http://leeds.gisruk.org/">Leeds</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradford">Bradford</a>:</p>

<p><img src="http://robinlovelace.net/figure/cconnect.png" alt="cityconnect" /></p>

<p>This is a fantastic example of the new levels of engagement unleashed by
online digital technologies such as <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>
and <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/search/shiny">shiny</a>: for the first time ever,
people can voice their opinions and pinpoint them to a specific place on the map
in a real-time discussion. The potential for improving transparency and
accountability in transport decision making is huge, as I described
in a short <a href="http://robinlovelace.net/software/2014/03/05/webmap-test.html">article on web-mapping</a> and as outlined in
an academic paper on the subject
(<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eet.1655/full">Schulz and Newig, 2014</a>).</p>

<p>As stated in the <a href="http://rpubs.com/RobinLovelace/54614">talk</a>,
the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/robin-lovelace-1/r-and-shiny-for-transport-applications">audio</a>
of which is available online (see below),
this is a fast-moving area that is likely to grow rapidly in the coming years.
So it&rsquo;s worth knowing what&rsquo;s out there and what is possible at present.</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/187078099&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Robinlovelace/learning-shiny/raw/master/learning-shiny.pdf">practical</a> avoids <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinventing_the_wheel">reinventing the wheel</a>
by building on and creating a narrative for <a href="http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/">RStudio&rsquo;s excellent tutorial and documentation of shiny</a>. For example, the
<a href="https://robinlovelace.shinyapps.io/himod/">himod</a> shiny app is simply a modified
version of the &lsquo;<a href="http://glimmer.rstudio.com/shiny/01_hello/">01_hello</a>&lsquo;
demonstration app used to illustrate how new
<a href="http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/lesson3/">widgets</a> are created and how to
use their id&rsquo;s as objects (via <code>input$id</code>) in server.R:</p>

<iframe src="https://robinlovelace.shinyapps.io/himod/" style="border: none; width: 600px; height: 650px"></iframe>

<p>So please take a look at the resources generated for this practical. I&rsquo;d
be interested to hear peoples&rsquo; thoughts on online interactive tools for
transport planning and the
<a href="http://theconversation.com/digital-democracy-lets-you-write-your-own-laws-21483">digital democracy</a> agenda. More specifically, what&rsquo;s the simplest way to get
an interactive map on shiny, as illustrated by the impressive
<a href="http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/superzip-example.html">map of the USA in the SuperZip shiny Gallery example</a>?</p>
