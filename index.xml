      <description>UseR! is the highest profile and, I believe, most popular annual meeting for R afficionados, known affectionately as â€˜UseRsâ€™ for the purposes of the event. For those who have been living under a stone for the past decade ;) R is an open source statistical programming language that has seen explosive growth since â€˜data scienceâ€™ became a buzzword.</description>

      <description>Lecture and book launch, part of Leeds Digital Festival This talk will introduce Geocomputation with R, a new book on R for geographic data that has just been published. Aimed at people new to the subject, Iâ€™ll provide some examples to show the power of programming with open source software for high-performance, reproducible mapping and geographic analyis. I will cover a bit of the history but focus on visualisation, which is key to using data to understand the world.</description>

      <description>Keynote talk at SatRdays Newcastle Geocomputation with R: Reproducible Geo* workflows, from getting data to making maps This talk will introduce Geocomputation with R, a new book on R for geographic data. It will demonstrate how far R has evolved as an environment for geographic data analysis and visualisation, and provide a taster of what is in the book and, more importantly, what is possible when &amp;lsquo;data science&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;GIS&amp;rsquo; meet.</description>

      <description>I am very happy to announce that the paper stplanr: A package for transport planning has been published in The R Journal (Lovelace and Ellison 2018) ðŸŽ‰.
This is the result of around 3 years of work: it took us (co-author Richard Ellison and me) over a year to get round to writing the paper after the stplanr package was first released on CRAN in November 2015 (see its archive on CRAN for details); it wasnâ€™t until March 2017 that the paper was formally submitted.</description>

      <description>The previous post demonstrated a new method to aggregate overlapping lines. It showed how to combine 2 lines that have an area of overlap. More excitingly, it led to the creation of a new function in stplanr, overline_sf(), that lives in the development version of the package. The purpose of this post is to provide an update on the status of the work to refactor the overline() function, in a human friendly alternative to discussion in the relevant GitHub issue: https://github.</description>

      <description>Introduction Itâ€™s been a busy 12 months but with the Geocomputation with R book nearing completion1 Iâ€™ve finally found some time to update my blog and do a bit of thinking, about the tangled topic of line aggregation.
 Why aggregate lines? The transport â€˜flowâ€™ on any particular segment of the transport networks is the aggregate (sum) of trips that pass through it (Hollander 2016). Finding the flow across a transport network based on input data composed of individual routes, is therefore an aggregation problem.</description>

      <description> This was the finale of a week of research collaboration and teaching at the Friedrich-Schiller-UniversitÃ¤t Jena Institut fÃ¼r Geographie. During the study visit I also worked on Geocomputation with R with fellow co-author Jannes Muenchow and wrote a tutorial on route network analysis in R that can be found at https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocomp-tranport-workshop

      <description>I presented yesterday on the use of geographic data in policy in a flamboyantly named talk: Can geographic data save the world (slides available from rpubs.com/Robinlovelace). The purpose of this post is to share the slides, audio and some of the ideas resulting from the talk, for the benefit of people interested in the topic but unable to attend.

Hereâ€™s a test plot, to show how it allows R code to be embedded:

      <description>After 2 years in the making, the paper describing the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT), and the thinking behind it, has finally been published (Lovelace et al. 2016). The PCT is an online tool for helping to decide where to prioritise cycling policies such as new cycle paths.
The PCT would not have been possible without CycleStreets.net, so as well as describing the PCT and it&amp;rsquo;s use of their routing services, this article serves as a big Thank You from PCT to CycleStreets.</description>

      <description>Last week I went to GEOSTAT 2016. Given the amount of fun had at GEOSTAT 2015, expectations were high. The local organisers did not disappoint, with a week of lectures, workshops, spatial data competitions and of course lots of Geostatistics. It would be unwise to try to systematically document such a diverse range of activities, and the GEOSTAT website provides much further info. Instead this &amp;lsquo;miniwriteup&amp;rsquo; is designed to summarise some of my memories from the event, and encourage you to get involved for GEOSTAT 2017.</description>

      <description>The 23rd iteration of the GIS Research UK conference (#GISRUK) conference was the largest ever. 250 researchers, industry representatives and academics attended from the vibrant geospatial research communities in the UK, Europe and beyond. GISRUK has become a centrepoint for discussion of new methods, software and applications in the field. I was on the organising committee, reviewed some excellent papers for the event (a full list of these is available for download here) and attended some truly ground-breaking talks.</description>

      <description>This is a review I was invited to write for Environmental Values, a journal for academics to publish their musings on the state of the environment and what is to be done about it. I found the book good, but was perhaps overly gushing in my review on their website in hindsight. Why? Well since my review there have been another couple of assessments from respected sources that are mixed to say the least.</description>

      <title>Moving house by bicycle trailer</title>

      <guid>/2013/10/13/moving-house-by-bicycle-trailer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in 2009 I moved from York to Sheffield to start a PhD on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://e-futures.group.shef.ac.uk/page/home/&#34;&gt;Energy Futures&lt;/a&gt; 4 year Doctoral Training Centre.
Young and naive, some friends and I decided to do it by bicycle, with one bicycle trailer filled to the brim and 4 large panniers carrying most of my stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 years later and I&amp;rsquo;ve moved again, this time to Leeds. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a new a job at Leeds University,
 working on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.geotalisman.org/&#34;&gt;Geotalisman&lt;/a&gt; project in the department of geography.
Older and hopefully wiser, I decided to move house by bicycle again: it&amp;rsquo;s shorter than the trip to York
(40 miles, not 60), I was more organised with planning (providing a month&amp;rsquo;s notice for friends and
family to attend and after 4 years in Sheffield I knew many people who would be up for the ride.
To make it more exciting, this time we brought music, in the form of a 12v sound system.
See the map, words, images and video below for the full low-down on this epic ride.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I presented last Thursday at &lt;a href=&#34;http://2013.foss4g.org/&#34;&gt;FOSS4G&lt;/a&gt;, THE conference to go to for Free Open Source Software for Geo applications (get it?). It was an interesting event, with hundreds of delegates dressing up in one form or another as Robin Hood, fantastic food and a very wide range of talks. Just take a look at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://2013.foss4g.org/conf/programme/daily/2/&#34;&gt;second day&lt;/a&gt; of talks: packed to the rafters with sessions, including &lt;a href=&#34;http://2013.foss4g.org/conf/programme/sessions/36/&#34;&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt;, on visualisation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
