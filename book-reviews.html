Despite the growing importance of the internet and associated digital media, books
remain an important medium for the transfer of information. Even with a long
web-page, the information is difficult to digest with the same depth of understanding
as with a book, because of the incessant distractions and short-termism of the internet.

Here's something I wrote in my first proper book review and the sentiment still rings true:

 <blockquote cite="http://nowthenmagazine.com/issue-37/the-ecotechnic-future/">
There's something amazing about books. Seemingly alone, you can conjure up the dead and indulge in the adventures of beings from the other side of the world (or Universe!) You can transcend the daily grind of life, immersed in the battle to survive the Orc onslaught, or captured by beautiful, gripping dystopian visions like 1984 or A Brave New World. Books have inspired me in ways that things like Twitter messages, I-phones or Newsnight never could. That's why this article begins with a book review.

Below is an up-to-date list of my book reviews to date, as a homage to the greatness of this ancient form of communication.
You can also find my reviews of books and other things on
<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/pdp/profile/A26SC2QOYJ3ABL?ie=UTF8&ref_=cm_cr_rdp_pdp">my page on Amazon's
website</a>. I'm not recommending shopping there but
it's undoubtedly a good source of reviews!
