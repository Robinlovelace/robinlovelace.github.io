Regular expressions in RStudio
========================================================

Many R users are accustomed to 'regex' the family of languages and
commands used for manipulating text strings. More specifically, 
regualar expressions are typically used for finding specific patterns and
replacing them with others.

In this post we are going to see a few reproducible examples of R's
implementation of regular expressions and how it can make your life easier.
To differentiate this information from previous articles on regex in 
in R () and in an attempt to adhere to the DRY principle, the focus will
be on the basic commands, flavours of regex in R and a topic that appears to
be rather under-documented online: RStudio's implementation of regex with
is confusingly different from R's default regex behaviour.

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```
