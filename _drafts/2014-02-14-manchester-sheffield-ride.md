title: Sheffield to Manchester cycle
---

I have recently arrived in Manchester, having cycled all the way from Sheffield. 
This may sound like a [masochistic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadomasochism) 
mid February activity. But I can only report good vibes: a subtle rush of 
[endorphins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorphins) released from pushing the 
body and the satisfaction of knowing I got here with my own energies alone, 
rather than depending on [ancient sunlight](http://techalive.mtu.edu/meec/module19/Page4.htm)
stored in fossil fuels and imported from afar. 

The route I took was fast, fun, safe yet exciting. Having done the trip multiple times
and feeling sure that this is the best route I've taken so far I feel compelled to share
it with the world (see map below).

Speed vs fun vs safety compromise.

Glossop.

Sheffield to Manchester is a well worn path ...

With the ascendency of cycling as a fun, healthy cheap and environmentally friendly form of 
transport, there has also been much interest in doing the trip by bike. 

## Alternative routes

I am 
by no means the first to attempt the journey, and many alternative routes are available online.
[Cycle Sheffield](http://www.cyclesheffield.org.uk/), offers a 
[detailed description](http://www.cyclesheffield.org.uk/route-planning/long-distance-routes/sheffield-to-manchester/)
of a 
largely rural route (see map below). 

<iframe src="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msa=0&amp;msid=204112132629730101627.0004a38bf89ff2c48e1cb&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;ll=53.390534,-1.793089&amp;spn=0.112659,0.661068&amp;output=embed" height="350" width="425" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><br />

This route avoids the car-infested Snake and Woodhead Pass, the former 
because "it is narrow and has fast traffic", the latter being "a highly undesirable place to be for a cyclist". 
Having ridden both routes, I would say that both descriptions are a little exagerated: yes cars tend to 
whizz over the snake pass and yes there is a high proportion of trucks in the traffic in the flow over Woodhead. 
But neither felt inherently dangerous at any time: in some ways the long expanses of road space felt safer
per kilometre than urban traffic, which is far less predictable (due to cars pulling out, traffic lights, left
and right turns and other urban phonomena).

An even more rural route is the [trans pennine trail](http://www.gps-routes.co.uk/routes/home.nsf/RoutesLinksCycle/trans-pennine-trail-walking-and-cycle-route), a completely off-road trail of which Sheffield-Manchester is 
only a part: it runs from coast to coast. Again, this route is ideal for leisure purposes, but 
will be much slower than the road option I took.
