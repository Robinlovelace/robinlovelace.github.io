Helen Bowkett - much experience modelling transport. "Why is cycling so hard to model?"
Now works for Welsh Government. Has experience creating local and regional models for 
both the Department for Transport and Local Authority level. 

The 4 stage transport model. 

Trip generation

Distribution

Split

Network assignment

Model developed to help with road construction: how many cars to 
expect on different roads? How will new building developments influence traffic?

Model has been extended to answer public transport questions, with mutli modal models. 

Reason: data is not there on cycling, in terms of:

- databases e.g. the TRICS database
- travel diaries often omit cyclists
- not picked up by automatic traffic counters
- size of zones - often cyclists don't cross two zones, so not picked up.

"Cyclists are unruly" and difficult to interview. 

Logit regression model used to allocate probability of mode of travel used. 

Reason: cyclists are difficult to allocate to the travel network 

Wheras a car journey from A to B will most likely take a specific route, 
the route that a cyclist takes will vary greatly, depending on a number of 
factors. The stereotypical 'lycra clad' experienced urban cyclist may cycle on 
the roads, following a similar route as car drivers. 

Tim Gent (WSP group) has developed has developed the Cambridge Sub Regional Model (CSRM), 
which separates out cyclists out from walkers.
His clients are local authorities who need the model to decide 
priorities for the transport infrastructure. In the CSRM the Highway model is dealt with by SATURN. 
Considers sensitivy of cyclists to distance. 


## John parkin - A review of methodologies for modelling cycling within junction appraisal

Going to focus on operational 

Junction modelling revolves around gaps between the cars and 
is heavily dependent on individuals' 'gap acceptance' which varies from person to person. 
Various estimate of PCU (passenger car units) for cyclists. 

Formula to calculate capacity of roundabouts. 

V. interesting modelling challenges mathematically.  

Cellular automota approach is good at dividing up the road network
into distinct blocks, e.g. pavement, on-road cycleway and open road 
which have different level of attractiveness for different cyclists.
