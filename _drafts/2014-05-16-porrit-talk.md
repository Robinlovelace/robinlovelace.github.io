title: How we made Herefordshire. A talk by Jonathan Porrit for the Bulmers foundation
---

This talk was organised by the [Bulmers Foundation](), an charity
based in the rural country of Herefordshire aiming to contribute a more
sustainable future for Herefordians. Being from Herefordshire myself, this was a
topic I was very interested in and greatly enjoyed Jonathan Porrit's take on it
(he lives in neighbouring Cheltenham). The talk itself was largely about the
technologies that will help enable the economy to run without burning fossil
fuels. "100% renewable" is the bold target that Porritt advocates, and he
certainly provided a vision for the rural economy that is very different from
the current system which is hopelessly dependent on fossil fuels.

The talk itself can be listened to via the soundcloude box. Below I offer some
commentary on it, and what I think it means for the future of my home town. A
spoiler: the prospect of moving back to Hereford at some point seems much rosier
than before and it seems there has been a revolution in the long-term thinking
amongst the 'powers that be' that is hugely encouraging. However, there is a
technological optimism in visions of the future that is completely out of kilter
with the latest developments in science and technology. See more below!
