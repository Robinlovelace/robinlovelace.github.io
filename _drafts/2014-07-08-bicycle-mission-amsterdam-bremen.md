The European branch of the Free and Open Source Software for Geo-spatial
conference ([FOSS4G-E]()) is rapidly approaching, in Bremen, Germany. The event
takes place from the 15th to the 17th of July: 3 days of intense open source
festivities. As a long-term advocate and user of open source geo-spatial
technology, people are getting excited already.

Even more exciting for me is my multi-mode method of transport there: I'll be voyaging by
train (Leeds-Hull), Ferry (Hull-Rotterdam) and bicycle (Rotterdam-Bremen), on a
mission to explore the cycle infrastructure of North Netherlands and Germany and
to increase the fun excitement and healthiness of long-distance travel. Naively,
I suppose, I still hope that [cycling could help save the world]().

In any case, my proposed route is shown below. In the hope that this will be
useful to future ecotechnical travellers I will write-up a summary of the
experience in future posts. Viva la bicycleta!
