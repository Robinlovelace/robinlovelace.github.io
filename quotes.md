This is a selection of some of my favourite phrases, harvested from a variety of sources.
Rather than simply providing a list, each quote is given a topic and, in some cases, is followed by a
brief explanation. Links to to the source material are made wherever possible;
good quotes are best seen in the wider context.

## Friendship

> It is the mark of a modest man to accept his friendly circle ready made from the 
> hands of opportunity

Robert Louis Stevenson, [Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42), 1886, p. 1.

This quote for me sums up the importance of accepting people who are different from oneself in 
everyday life. Those who try to hand pick their acquaintances based on hasty value judgements, 
rather than simply based on *who they are* are the implicit arrogant target of this beautiful sentence.

## Fear

> Fear paralyses creativity, stultifies the imagination, reduces problem-solving ability, 
> damages health, depletes energy, saps intelligence and destroys hope. 

Sara Maitland, [Far from the Madding Crowd](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/11/why-society-problem-being-alone), *The Guardian
Review*, p. 19.

Fear is an emotion that we evolved as apes and early hunter gatherers living off the land.
In modern civilisation, this animal instinct wreaks havoc, inflicting far more suffering than
safety. As Sara Maitland points out in her article, fear is harnessed by the mainstream media
to sell stories as well as by politicians to win votes. More prosaically, fear stops parents
from letting their children run free due to a distorted perception of the risks of abduction,
as discussed in an [article for Now Then Magazine](http://nowthenmagazine.com/issue-33/fear/).

## Transport

> Towards the end of the 20th century, and thanks to the private automobile, a simple worker could live in one place but carry out their work,
> daily, 50 to 60 km away. This fact, which for the citizen formed part of their everyday routine, constitutes, without doubt, one of the greatest enigmas of Anthropology and History.

Jose Ardillo, 2011, *[El Salario del Gigante](http://www.pepitas.net/libro/el-salario-del-gigante)*

This was the opening quote of my thesis. It appeared in a Spanish novel set in 2099 in a
dystopian future where energy supplies and other resources are depleted. It expresses
neatly the wastefulness of our current transport system and raises the question
of whether we'll voluntarily change our ways or be forced out of daily long-distance travel
by oil shortages.

## Data and modelling

> Human beings are remarkably adept at discerning relationships from visual
> representations. A well-crafted graph can help you make meaningful comparisons among thousands of pieces of information, extracting patterns not easily found through other methods. This is one reason why advances in the field of statistical graphics have had such a major impact on data analysis. Data analysts need to look at their data, and this is one area where R shines.
