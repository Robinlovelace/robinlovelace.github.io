This is a selection of quotations that I've come across in my travels.
I link back to the source material wherever possible, as good quotes are often
best seen in the wider context. 

> It is the mark of a modest man to accept his friendly circle ready made from the 
> hands of opportunity

Robert Louis Stevenson's [Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42), 1886, p. 1.

This quote for me sums up the importance of accepting people who are different from oneself in 
everyday life. Those who try to hand pick their acquaintances based on hasty value judgements, 
rather than simply based on *who they are* are the implicit arrogant target of this beautiful sentence.
