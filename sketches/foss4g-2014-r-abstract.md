# Teaching R as a command line GIS and spatial data analysis environment

In recent years, R's spatial capabilities have increased rapidly with 
the development of dozens dedicated spatial packages and hundreds of 
proven applications in academic research and beyond. With the emergence 
of user friendly graphical interfaces for - such as RStudio - and ever
improving documentation, R is also now more accessible than ever before. 
Yet R has received relatively little attention from the GIS community 
overall and advocates of free and open source software for geographic
application (FOSS4G) in particular. In this paper we provide an argument
for increased understanding and use of R as a command line application
for applied GIS and demonstrate how it can be used to effortlessly 
undertake advanced spatial modelling and analysis *and* visualisation 
within a cohesive environment. The ultimate aim is to unleash 
the  "tremendous amount of flexibility and power waiting for you with the command
line" (Sherman 2008). Our paper is thus both conceptual and practical
with reproducible code and data based around a case study on the construction, 
analysis and visualisation of a spatial interaction model of museum visits.
