Here is a small list of ideas for this website:

- Each major category on the website begins with a high quality, general introduction to the 
topic and then, after a dividing line, continues with the most recent posts in that area. 
- New category: bicycles, energy, academia, economics, politics, thesis, videos, Hire Me! (satirical), 
heroes (sound cloud of The Fall - No More heros).
- Add a dynamic map of my travels by bicycle.
- Social media, 'follow' etc?
- About?
- Calendar
