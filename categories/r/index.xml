      <title>Six great things about UseR! 2019</title>

      <description>UseR! is the highest profile and, I believe, most popular annual meeting for R afficionados, known affectionately as â€˜UseRsâ€™ for the purposes of the event. For those who have been living under a stone for the past decade ;) R is an open source statistical programming language that has seen explosive growth since â€˜data scienceâ€™ became a buzzword.</description>

      <title>stplanr paper published</title>

      <description>I am very happy to announce that the paper stplanr: A package for transport planning has been published in The R Journal (Lovelace and Ellison 2018) ðŸŽ‰.
This is the result of around 3 years of work: it took us (co-author Richard Ellison and me) over a year to get round to writing the paper after the stplanr package was first released on CRAN in November 2015 (see its archive on CRAN for details); it wasnâ€™t until March 2017 that the paper was formally submitted.</description>

      <title>Aggregating lines, part II</title>

      <description>The previous post demonstrated a new method to aggregate overlapping lines. It showed how to combine 2 lines that have an area of overlap. More excitingly, it led to the creation of a new function in stplanr, overline_sf(), that lives in the development version of the package. The purpose of this post is to provide an update on the status of the work to refactor the overline() function, in a human friendly alternative to discussion in the relevant GitHub issue: https://github.</description>

      <description>Introduction Itâ€™s been a busy 12 months but with the Geocomputation with R book nearing completion1 Iâ€™ve finally found some time to update my blog and do a bit of thinking, about the tangled topic of line aggregation.
 Why aggregate lines? The transport â€˜flowâ€™ on any particular segment of the transport networks is the aggregate (sum) of trips that pass through it (Hollander 2016). Finding the flow across a transport network based on input data composed of individual routes, is therefore an aggregation problem.</description>

      <description>Iâ€™ve finally got a new blog post, to test that my new set-up is working, using the wonderful new blogdown package.
Hereâ€™s a test plot, to show how it allows R code to be embedded:
plot(1:9) Now that I have a quick-fire and fun way of getting new content onto the web I expect to be blogging lots more.

      <description>Last week I went to GEOSTAT 2016. Given the amount of fun had at GEOSTAT 2015, expectations were high. The local organisers did not disappoint, with a week of lectures, workshops, spatial data competitions and of course lots of Geostatistics. It would be unwise to try to systematically document such a diverse range of activities, and the GEOSTAT website provides much further info. Instead this &amp;lsquo;miniwriteup&amp;rsquo; is designed to summarise some of my memories from the event, and encourage you to get involved for GEOSTAT 2017.</description>

      <title>R vs QGIS for sustainable transport planning</title>

      <description>The 23rd iteration of the GIS Research UK conference (#GISRUK) conference was the largest ever. 250 researchers, industry representatives and academics attended from the vibrant geospatial research communities in the UK, Europe and beyond. GISRUK has become a centrepoint for discussion of new methods, software and applications in the field. I was on the organising committee, reviewed some excellent papers for the event (a full list of these is available for download here) and attended some truly ground-breaking talks.</description>
