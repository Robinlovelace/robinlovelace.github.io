      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in 2009 I moved from York to Sheffield to start a PhD on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://e-futures.group.shef.ac.uk/page/home/&#34;&gt;Energy Futures&lt;/a&gt; 4 year Doctoral Training Centre.
Young and naive, some friends and I decided to do it by bicycle, with one bicycle trailer filled to the brim and 4 large panniers carrying most of my stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 years later and I&amp;rsquo;ve moved again, this time to Leeds. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a new a job at Leeds University,
 working on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.geotalisman.org/&#34;&gt;Geotalisman&lt;/a&gt; project in the department of geography.
Older and hopefully wiser, I decided to move house by bicycle again: it&amp;rsquo;s shorter than the trip to York
(40 miles, not 60), I was more organised with planning (providing a month&amp;rsquo;s notice for friends and
family to attend and after 4 years in Sheffield I knew many people who would be up for the ride.
To make it more exciting, this time we brought music, in the form of a 12v sound system.
See the map, words, images and video below for the full low-down on this epic ride.&lt;/p&gt;
